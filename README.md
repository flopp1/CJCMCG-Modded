# CJCMCG-Modded
A modification of CJC's MIDI Counter Generator that makes generating notecounters for trillion MIDIs super fast and easy, that it can be done within minutes!

# How it works
Basically adds a multiplier parameter such that you can just input the base file of the midi and the multiplier, and the program will do the math for you and generate a visually identical notecounter to the trillion midi.

# Changelog
* Note: v0.1 isn't shown in the commit history because the folder I originally developed in was separate from the repo, then I decided to start over so that I could use Github Desktop for my commits. 

# Version 0.1
* Added multiplier, didn't change much else

# Version 0.2
* Removed lyrics processing function as well as original render (used a temp folder to store the video images instead of RAM) because no one uses it.
* Updated .NET version to 7.0.101, .NET framework to v4.8.1, and SharpCompress to v0.32.2 (was hoping that performance would have a big jump but no, only marginal increases lol)
* Removed packages.config because it was unnecessary
